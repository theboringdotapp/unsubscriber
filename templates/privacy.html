        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>Last Updated: May 2, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to Unsubscriber ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our web application accessible at [Your App URL] (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Access</h2>
        <p>When you authenticate with your Google account, we request permission to access certain information from your Gmail account solely for the purpose of providing the Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Headers (Read-Only Scope):</strong> We access the headers (like 'From', 'Subject', 'Date', and 'List-Unsubscribe') of your recent emails. This is used to identify potential subscriptions and extract unsubscribe links or email addresses. We do <strong class="text-brand">not</strong> read the body content of your emails with this basic permission level.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Modification (Optional Scope):</strong> If you choose to enable the "Archive emails" feature, we request additional permission to modify your emails (<code class="text-xs bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded">gmail.modify</code> scope). This permission is used <strong class="text-brand">exclusively</strong> to move processed emails from your Inbox to your Archive (by removing the 'INBOX' label). We do <strong class="text-brand">not</strong> delete emails or modify them in any other way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifying Subscriptions:</strong> Email headers are scanned locally in your browser or transiently on our server during the scan process to find 'List-Unsubscribe' information.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitating Unsubscribes:</strong> We use the extracted unsubscribe links (HTTP links or mailto: addresses) to help you unsubscribe. HTTP links may be opened directly or processed via a server proxy. Mailto links will typically open your default email client.</li>
            <li><strong>Archiving (Optional):</strong> If you grant permission and enable the feature, we use the Gmail API to remove the 'INBOX' label from selected emails after processing unsubscribe requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your data. Here's how we handle storage and security:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transient Processing:</strong> We do <strong class="text-brand">not</strong> store your email content or headers persistently on our servers. Information required for identifying unsubscribe links (email headers) is processed transiently in memory during the scan request within our secure cloud function environment and is discarded immediately after the scan results are provided to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Google OAuth 2.0 tokens (access and refresh tokens) grant the application access to your Gmail data according to the scopes you approve. These tokens are sensitive and are stored securely:
                <ul>
                    <li>Tokens are stored encrypted within your server-side session, managed by our hosting provider's secure infrastructure (e.g., Vercel).</li>
                    <li>Access to these tokens is strictly limited to the necessary application functions for communicating with the Gmail API on your behalf.</li>
                    <li>All communication between your browser, our servers, and Google's servers uses HTTPS encryption to protect data in transit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Minimal Scope Usage:</strong> We request the minimum necessary permissions (scopes) from Google to perform the app's functions (reading headers, optionally modifying labels for archiving). We do not request broader access than required.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Our data handling practices adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:underline">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>We believe in minimizing data retention. Here's our policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Data:</strong> As stated above, email header data is processed transiently and <strong class="text-brand">never stored</strong> after the scan request is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> OAuth tokens stored in your session are retained only for the duration of your active session. They are automatically deleted when:
                <ul>
                    <li>You explicitly log out of the Service.</li>
                    <li>Your session expires due to inactivity (as managed by the hosting platform).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion / Revocation:</strong> You have full control over the application's access to your Google Account. You can revoke Unsubscriber's permissions at any time via your Google Account settings (<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:underline">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>). Revoking permissions immediately invalidates any stored tokens, effectively deleting the application's ability to access your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> While tokens expire with sessions, we do not currently implement a separate process for deleting inactive user *accounts* themselves, as we do not store user account information persistently outside of the session tokens. If you revoke access via Google, the connection is severed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Authentication:</strong> We use Google OAuth for authentication. Your interaction with Google is governed by Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
             <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> The application is hosted on Vercel. Vercel's privacy policy applies to the infrastructure.</li>
             <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Umami for simple, privacy-focused analytics (page views, feature usage) to improve the service. Umami does not use cookies and anonymizes IP addresses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can review and revoke the permissions granted to Unsubscriber at any time through your Google Account settings (<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:underline">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Logout:</strong> Logging out clears your session and stored authentication tokens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>Unsubscriber is open source. You can review the code on <a href="https://github.com/theboring-app/unsubscriber" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:underline">GitHub</a> to verify how your data is handled.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
